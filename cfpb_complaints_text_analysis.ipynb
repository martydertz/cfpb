    "\n",
    "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) was created as part of the Dodd-Frank Financial Protection Act, and it's mission is to empower and educate consumers about financial products. CFPB also is responsible for enforcing financial regulations. Therefore consumer complaints hold useful information both for CFPB and the customers they serve. In the following sections we connect to the complaints data and do an exploratory analysis of the narratives provided by customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Along the way we'll highlight areas that may be useful to CFPB, both in educating & empowering consumers within its Division of Consumer Education and Engagement and Division of Research Markets and Regulation. \n",

    "The big idea behind creating a DTM is that each document -- in our case mortgage complaint narratives -- can be represented as a vector. Using vectors we can compute things like distance and similarity between narratives. But some words -- like 'the', 'a', 'it' -- occur so frequently in English text they'll be in nearly 100% of the narratives and therefore don't add much value to our DTM. Think of it like this -- if I tell you two narratives use the word 'the' and 'it' five times you likely haven't learned anything about their content, but if I tell you two narratives contain the words 'refinance' and 'foreclosure' 5 times you can begin to make some inferences about what other words they include. \n",

Originally, I was cosigner on a mortgage note that I subsequently included in a now discharged Bankruptcy. The co-borrower and I were given instructions for her to retain property post Bankruptcy. The Co-borrower was instructed to complete an acquisition inquiry where they assess her ability to pay. She did successfully complete a loan modification, not including my income or information with Bay view, and without my completing any reaffirmation paperwork. On contrary, at the time I signed all required papers to relinquish any property claims. However, Bayview had failed to stop reporting to the credit bureaus for the note. However, when I call they say I am not on the note, but reported significant lates XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. The mortgage has since been sold off to XXXX XXXX XXXX, In which case XXXX XXXX XXXX does not report to my credit. I gave been trying to get Bayview to remove this from my credit intermittently since XX/XX/XXXX. However, over the last 6-months I have been aggressive in trying to get this resolved and consistently hit a brick wall. First, I was directed to XXXX XXXX XXXX , XXXX XXXX XXXX direct me to Bayview, I filed disputes directly with credit Bureaus. The credit Bureaus stated it is for Bayview to correct. XX/XX/XXXX I finally was submitted to the escalation center at Bayview Florida office to assist with the issue. They claim they were originally not clear on what my claim was, and asked for supporting documentation. They acknowledged that they were able to see and view the bankruptcy on the computer in conjunction with the information I sent. XXXX I was told, that the rep would review and get back to me in 48-hours. However, I did n't get any answer. After a few days of no response and leaving unreturned voicemails. I recorded a voicemail, and disclosed as much to the representative. Who then returned my call furious and refused to speak with me verbally. She said I would receive something in the mail in 30-days. I was going to file a complaint then but was in the midst of trying to get a mortgage and had feared that it would cause further delay. SO, in thinking the information that was sent was sufficient I waited. The-30-days expired around XX/XX/XXXX with no update or response. I called back in, and they now claim they do not see who I was dealing with, and can not disclose any information cause I am not on the loan. I was then asked to send in all the documentation I previously sent. I did send the requested documentation, but I am also, seeking additional help as I am trying again to purchase another property. This represent a major issue as my credit is fragile with the Bankruptcy. Therefore, it has a negative impact to have such serious delinquencies on a mortgage. I have lost the XXXX property that I was trying to obtain, along with my deposit based on the time I strung sellers along trying to get this issued fixed. \\nI am submitting my Bankruptcy discharge along with list of creditors, I copy of the credit summary from bank that shows when Bayview reported delinquencies, a small potion of my phone bill that shows calls to XXXX, FL where I followed up with the Bayview. There others from landlines but those specifically are the ones where they committed to an update in 30-days. There is also, an email where I previously sought customer service guidance XX/XX/XXXX in was sent a survey after call. I can also, show if necessary, that I have not participated on any level on this mortgage since my bankruptcy. I know that the other borrower as had her mortgage reduced based on my income obligations being removed by the bankruptcy court. \\n\", 'Bayview Loan Servicing, LLC')\n",
